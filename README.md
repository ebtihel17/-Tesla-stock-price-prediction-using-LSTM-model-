# 📌Tesla stock price prediction using LSTM model💰📈

Using machine learning techniques, I've developed an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model trained on historical data to forecast the future performance of Tesla's stock price. 🚀📊

This project can be divided into four major parts :

📍1️⃣ Historical Stock Price Data Acquisition: Gathering historical stock price data for Tesla. This involves accessing reliable APIs to retrieve the necessary information. Historical data is crucial for training our LSTM model and understanding past trends and patterns.

📍2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis. This step allows us to understand the data better, identify any outliers or missing values, visualize trends. EDA will serve as the foundation for building our LSTM model.

📍3️⃣ LSTM Model Building: Constructing a powerful LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) specifically designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them ideal for time series analysis like stock price prediction. This step incudes preprocessing the data, spliting it into training and testing sets, designing the LSTM architecture, and training the model on historical data.

📍4️⃣ Stock Price Forecasting: Making future predictions:
Using the latest available data, the model will generate forecasts for Tesla's stock price. These predictions will provide valuable insights into potential price movements, allowing investors to make informed decisions about their investment strategies.
